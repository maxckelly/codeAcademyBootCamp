## MongoDB Atlas 

- MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database developed by the same people that build MongoDB. Atlas allows you to deploy and manage a MongoDB database on many different cloud service providers (including AWS, Azure and GCP). Follow the links below to get started.
- https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas

- Step 1: Create an account by using: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center
- Step 2: Fill in the information like the below image:

- Step 3: Once you have created the cluster you will be directed to the dashboard:

- Step 4: You will then need to create a user to access the database

- Step 5: You then create your user, enter the username and password which will be used to login to the database

- Step 7: You then want to add this to your app. Using a env file. Create a `.env` file in root
- You want to also install an npm `npm install dotenv`
- Step 8: In your `.env` add `DB_URI=mongodb+srv://maxKelly:<password>@marketplacetest-kjcl8.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
- Step 9: Create a `.gitignore` file in root
- Step 10: In your `.gitignore` add `.env` this ignores the .env file
- Step 11: You then want to call that URL within your code so: `const mongoURI = process.env.DB_URL;` 
- Step 12: And when you connect to the db
```
mongoose.connect(mongoURI, {useNewUrlParser: true}, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    return console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
  } else {
    console.log("Connected to mongoDB")
  };
});
``` 


## NOW Package

- There are a plethora of different options for deployment Express projects; one option we could use again is Heroku.
- This time though, we are going to use a new service called Now. Now can be used for heaps of different types of deployments including React but for this course weâ€™re just going to use it for our Express back ends.

- Install NOW globally `npm install -g now`
- Run `now login` 
- Enter in your email address - NOTE: If you don't have an account you will need to create one through the link they provide you
