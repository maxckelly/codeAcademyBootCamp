- Added Google mailer so I can send emails and confirm users address
- Moved the profile picture to be attached to the user as well as added a full name input
- Handled errors for when there is no parent or sitter. 
- Installed Figaro to secure google credentials 
- Start work on implementing Google Maps. I'm trying to use a gem called GeoCoder with this but facing some issues with getting the longitude and latitude from the address field I'm passing.
