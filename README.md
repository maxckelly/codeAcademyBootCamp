# My Coder Academy Boot Camp Experience
- A 6 month course where I will learn Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Ruby on Rails and more...

## Ruby 
- We spent three weeks learning - If statements, loops, arrays, variables, GEMS, classes, methods and more... We built a terminal app over three days applying the knowledge we learnt - https://github.com/maxckelly/travelApp 
## HTML/CSS
- I created my portfolio with HTML and CSS. This was all designed and created by myself - I designed an SVG and implemented that as the background.

## Ruby on Rails 
- For Ruby on Rails I created a marketplace application. This application was a baby sitter app which allowed parents to go online and quickly book a baby sitter. In this application I implemented a login and signup with authentication and email confirmination as well as a payment system (Stripe) and Google API. See below links to view:
