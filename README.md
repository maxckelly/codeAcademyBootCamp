## Ruby

## HTML/CSS
- I created my portfolio with HTML and CSS. This was all designed and created by myself - I designed an SVG and implemented that as the background.

## Ruby on Rails 
- For Ruby on Rails I created a marketplace application. This application was a baby sitter app which allowed parents to go online and quickly book a baby sitter. In this application I implemented a login and sign up with authentication and email confirmation as well as a payment system (Stripe) and Google API. See below links to view:
