# My Coder Academy Boot Camp Experience

- A 6 month course where I will learn Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Ruby on Rails, Deployment, Computer Science Basics, Adding payment systems to your site and more...
# Term One
## Ruby 

- We spent three weeks learning - If statements, loops, arrays, variables, GEMS, classes, methods and more... We built a terminal app over three days applying the knowledge we learnt - https://github.com/maxckelly/travelApp 

## HTML/CSS

- I created my portfolio with HTML and CSS. This was all designed and created by myself - I designed an SVG and implemented that as the background.

# Term Two
## Ruby on Rails & PostgreSQL

- While at the start Ruby on Rails was a lot more complex then I had thought it would be. The idea of using a database and migrations caused confusion as to how to change columns, if I stuff something up how to resolve it, migrations and especially how to migrate the database on a new computer. However after a week or so I it all started to click and through trial and error I found it was really quick to get an site up and running. I learnt a lot of rails and now very comfortable with being able to build what I like. 
- For Ruby on Rails I created a marketplace application. This application was a baby sitter app which allowed parents to go online and quickly book a baby sitter. In this application I implemented a login and sign up with authentication and email confirmation as well as a payment system (Stripe) and Google API. See below links to view:

# Term Two
## JavaScript

- Half way through term two after finishing our Ruby on Rails assignment we began JavaScript. At first it seemed similar to Ruby in terms of if statements, loops etc... However once diving deeper into the language I noticed it was a lot more flexible and ridged than Ruby in a good. I feel there is a lot more control and possibilities with JavaScript than Ruby and the challenge is a lot more rewarding. 

# Term Three
## JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js & MongoDB, React

- During term 3 we started `Node.js` & `Express.js`. While we will be applying this to our project in term 4 we have recently applied this to test apps involves in marketplaces etc... 
- I have worked on a number of basic apps with the above languages and will be implementing these more in term four on our project.
