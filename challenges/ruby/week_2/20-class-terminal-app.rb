# The challenge is to create a restaurant app. The catch is you have to use classes. Let's break this down:

# Think about what a restaurant app should be able to do. For example, it should have a way to display the menu to the customers. It should be able to take orders. It should be able to calculate the total orders for different customers. Think about if the orders need to be a separate class.

# The app can be as simple as you want it to be - if you're comfortable with just one class, just use one class.

# Before you start coding, discuss with your partner and write down all your ideas. Then start coding. Hope you have fun!
