// Challenge
// 1. Create a new variable called user, set the value to: tom
// 2. Write an if statement: if the user's name is tom, say 'Hello Tom'
// 3. Add an else condition: say 'Hello someone other than Tom'
// 4. Add a new variable called age, set the value to: 18
// 5. If the user is 18, say 'welcome to the casino!'

let user = "Tom";
let age = 22;

if (age > 21) {
  console.log("You're a adult");
} else if (age < 21 && age >= 13 ) {
  console.log("You are a teenager");
} else {
  console.log("You're a child");
}


// 6. Research 'prompt'.Use it in your code to ask the user for their age.
