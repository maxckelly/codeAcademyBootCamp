# DataTypes
    # Strings, integers, floats - So this would be "thirty", 30, 30.0
    # String - is a word, text, character put in quotation marks "" , '' - "HELLO"
    # Integer - is a number with no decimal - "30"
    # Float - is a number with a decimal point - "30.0"
    # Boolean - This is true or false

# varibles are a way to store information. 
    # first_name = "Max"
    # varibles can be overided for example first_name = "John"
    # Or first_name = first_name.upcase
    # Examples of Variables:
        plus = 1+1 # This performs the equation when called 
        times = 1 * 5
        first_name = "Max" # This stores the string and when calls displays it.
        
# Methods are actions that can be performed
    # .upcase - Makes the letters all uppercase 
    # .downcase - Makes the letters all downcase 
    # .capitalize - Makes the first letter an uppercase letter
    # A mehtod always has a . (dot) before - If dot, think method.
